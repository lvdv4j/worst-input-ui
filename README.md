## Description
This is my take on the "Worst Phone Number UI" trend, a fun and playful "worst UI" program for entering a phone number. The program displays moving numbers on the screen, and users can click on the numbers to enter their phone number. Once the user enters 10 digits, a message box will ask if that is their number. Depending on the response, different message boxes will be displayed.

## Features
- Fun and playful user interface
- Moving numbers for user interaction
- Confirmation message box with humorous responses

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- tkinter (usually included with Python)

## Usage
1. Run the script `worst_ui_phone_number.py`.
2. The main window will appear with moving numbers and an instruction label.
3. Click on the moving numbers to enter your phone number.
4. Once you enter 10 digits, a confirmation message box will appear.
5. If you click "Yes," you will see a humorous congratulations message.
6. If you click "No," you will be prompted to try again.
